Welcome!

WebSNMP is a perl module for Apache Web Servers that allows
a web developer to easily insert snmp functionality into web
pages with simple html tags.  Please use
	perldoc Apache::WebSNMP 
for a detailed description.

PLEASE NOTE:  This module REQUIRES the perl SNMP module, which
can be downloaded from :
www.cpan.org

To install the module, simply do the usual:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

After this, you must add the following entry to your httpd.conf
file:

<Location /directory_name>
        SetHandler perl-script
        PerlHandler Apache::WebSNMP
</Location>

where "directory_name" is the location in your DocumentRoot
where you wish to put all of your snmp web documents.  Then 
simply restart your web server and you are ready to go!

Please direct any questions, comments, and suggesttions to:
websnmp@ecomm.savantnet.com

Thanks for trying WebSNMP!
